# ECE473-Project
My machine learning project from college
It is based on the Kaggle Spaceship Titanic problem.
This project contains 5 models: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Neural Network, and SVM.
Each Python file will output a csv that classifies each passenger.
The passengers are classified as either passing through the wormhole or not.
